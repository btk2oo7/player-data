# player-data
very incredibly unfinished

general playerdata module written to be dynamic and re-usable for all of my future games, where applicable.

## planned to include
- player inventory
- player stats
- containers (like chests)
- handle client requests with remote events
- debug data viewer

i will maybe finish this someday
